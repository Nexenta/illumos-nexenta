# Makefile.nza -- For only-open-source, this file will contain at most a few
# empty, but set, variables.  The environment variable NZA_MAKEDEFS will be
# set to this file for only-open-source builds.  If $WS/usr/nza-closed is
# present, that variable should be set to $WS/usr/nza-closed/Makefile.nza
#
# NZA is short for Nexenta ZFS Appliance, and it is a prefix not seen in any
# other Illumos source.  Anytime one encounters something starting with NZA,
# it means that there is most likely accompanying closed source that should
# live in $WS/usr/nza-closed/.
#
# This child-of-Illumos should be able to build by itself, if it does not,
# that will be at most a temporary condition.
#

# For the stmf_sbd mdb(1) modules, no extra includes are needed.
