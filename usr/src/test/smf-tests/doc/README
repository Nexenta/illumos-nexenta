================================================================================

1. Building & Installation

1.1 Installing from Packages

   o In the majority of cases, the test suite can be installed from
     packages.  The package is called system-test-smf and its default
     installation directory is /opt/smf-tests.  Installation is via
     the standard Solaris package installation tool pkgadd(1m).

     To install system-test-smf simply use platform pkg tools.

   o It is recommended that you install the packages from scratch, rather
     than on top of an existing installation.

1.2 Uninstalling the Test Suite Package

   o Prior to uninstalling the system-test-smf package, you may want to
     run stf_unconfigure from the top level directory.  Typically, this
     will be "/opt/smf-tests".  Unconfiguring the test suite is
     recommended if you have previously run the suite, and especially so,
     if you have run the test suite in non-global zones.  For more detail
     on how to unconfigure the suite see section 3.1.

   o To uninstall the package, use the platform pkg tool

1.3 Building the Test Suite (optional)

   o This method uses the standard STF techniques to create a Solaris
     package, which will be installed under the base directory
     "/opt/smf-tests".
 
     Briefly, this build and installation is performed as follows:

         # set path to STF bin directory
         % PATH=<path-to-STF>/bin/`uname -p`:$PATH
         % export PATH

         # WS_ROOT is the root of the workspace containing the
         # SMF test suite source code
         #
         % cd <WS_ROOT>/usr/src/test/smf-tests
         % stf_build package
         % cd <WS_ROOT>/packages/`uname -p`

1.4 System Requirements

   o Beginning with version 1.7 of this test suite, snv_102 or greater is
     required to successfully build and execute all tests.

================================================================================

2. Running the tests

2.1 Configuring and running the tests

2.1.1 Configure the tests

   o Configuration of the test suite is completed with the stf_configure
     command.
 
         % cd /opt/smf-tests; stf_configure

  o For stf_configure options refer to the STF User's Guide.

2.1.2 Run the tests

   o To execute all of the modes on current system platform:

         % cd /opt/smf-tests; stf_execute

   o To execute only test cases in a specific directory:

         % cd /opt/smf-tests/<test directory>; stf_execute

   o For other stf_execute options, refer to the STF User's Guide.

================================================================================

3. Unconfigure the suite.

   o Use the STF unconfigure tool.

         % cd /opt/smf-tests; stf_unconfigure  

================================================================================

4. Special Requirements

4.1 Zones test
   o  This suite includes a zones test to verify SMF services are properly 
      handled in non-global zones.  The test requires the Solaris package
      management scripts (pkgadd, pkgrm etc) and will not work with the IPS 
      packaging mechanism.
