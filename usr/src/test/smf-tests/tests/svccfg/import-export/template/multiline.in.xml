    Lissener hispert me, "What is it? Be they terning be they moving?"

    I hispert back, "Its broakin machines they aint moving." It wernt
nothing like when you dig up old rottin machines out of the groun these
were in ther parper working place nor nothing rottin they wer some kynd
of iron dint rot it wer all shyning all catching that shaky glimmer.
Some of them ther shels ben broak open you cud see girt shyning weals
like jynt mil stoans only smoov. Id all ways usit the word shyning same
as any 1 else myt. The sun is shyning or the moon is shyning. Youwl see
a shyning on the water or a womans hair. When you talk of the Little
Shyning Man its jus the middl word of what hes callt there aint no real
meaning to it. Suddn when I seen the shyning of them broakin machines I
begun to get some idear of the shyning of the Littl Man. Tears begun
streaming down my face and my froat akit.

    Lissener hispert, "Whats the matter?"

    I hispert back, "O what we ben! And what we come to!"

As he lay there dying, he reflected that God had been rather mean. Here
he&apos;d been so faithful to his belief, never wished for food when he was
starving, or a lover when he was lonely - and he&apos;d been so lonely. He
felt cheated, as if God had taken advantage of him. He felt somehow that
God hadn&apos;t been a very good sport.
But a few minutes before he died he happened to glance back at the rest
of the zoo, at the rest of the world.
He leaped to his feet, shocked at what he saw.
For he saw that God hadn&apos;t answered his wish at all.
And he realized that had he not taken his own life, God would have
granted one of his great wishes, because He hadn&apos;t made the flowers
giant. He&apos;d merely made the cage, the giraffes - and the man, very
small.
