# NAME
#	zero_size_test
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	zero_size_test <assert #> <compression type>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	This function contains the code used to test the special case of
#	zero-length files and lofiadm compression.  All of the test code
#	for these cases is in this function.  The test purpose files for
#	these cases just pass in the assertion ID number, the type of
#	compression used, and the name of the tp file (so the assertion
#	comments can be extracted from it).  This function then takes care
#	of the actual test.
#
#	Tests for additional compression types that may be added later can
#	be accomplished by just copying one of the existing zero-size tp
#	files and updating the assertion ID number and type of compression
#	in it.
#
# RETURN VALUE
#	Undefined
