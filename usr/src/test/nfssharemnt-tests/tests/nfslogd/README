DESCRIPTION:

The tests in this subdirectory verify nfslogd action with
different log tag. test_nfslog.ksh is run on server to do the
verification, optionally, it can do the following checks:
    - the location of the private file handle to path mapping
      database files.
    - the location of the private work buffer file.
    - the location of nfs log file and operations on test file
      are logged correctly in log file


HOW TO ADD NEW TEST:

The tests use dynamic assertion generation in STF, so it's very
simple if you want to add new tests with other tags. Only need
two steps:
    - add tag definition in nfslog.conf you want to test,
      specially, each tag is limited to one line as "awk" is used
      to do pattern match.
    - add corresponding log option to variable "Log_opts" in
      nfslogd.var.


NOTES:
    - According to different tag definition, three files for
      verification described above are located in different
      subdirs under /var/nfs/smtest/.
    - All test cases are named by prefix "NFSLOGD" combining
      with different log tag option and nfs version option.
    - Currently, nfslogd only supports nfsv2/v3. In the future,
      we might have nfs server logging for version 4, in
      addition to adding "vers=4" to variable "VEROPTS",
      possibly we need to call test_nfslogd with different
      arguments if work buffer and file handle file are not
      needed. See the comments in test_nfslogd.ksh.
    - According to nfslogd test strategy, multiple tests can not
      run at the same time, so the suite creates three lock
      files to serialize all cases in all clients to run one by
      one. The lock files exist under /var/tmp/sharemnt_lock on
      server. The content of these lock files as follows:

    .stf_configure
        1 : First client is doing setup on server
        0 : The setup on server is finished, other clients
            needn't do it.
    .stf_execute
        0 : No case is running, any case can get the lock.
        pid : One case is running, other cases aren't allowed to
              run at same time.
    .stf_unconfigure
        referent count for clients, increase 1 per client. Only
        last client does cleanup when the value is 1.
