DESCRIPTION:
===========
This test suite is mainly designed to test the functionality of COMSTAR 
(Common Multiprotocol SCSI Target) 

PREREQUISITES:
============
1. Test configuration needs ISCSI Initiator and ISCSI Target hosts.

   On both hosts, it is desirable to have an additional 2 NICs for test 
   transports.  Hosts will have an on-board interface to house the host 
   IP address being used for ssh communication between the target and 
   initiator host.  The other two NICs should be configured with IPs
   under different subnets for physical multi-path. 

   The ISCSI Initiator host will reboot itself automatically during 
   Fault Injection testing.

2. ISCSI Target Host should NOT have any existing LUs and related
   configuration information such as target group, host group, view 
   entry and mapping association before test execution. 

3. ISCSI Target Host should disable other target port providers,
   for example by unloading FC target driver, disabling the SMF 
   service /system/iscsitgt.  Otherwise unxepected failures will
   be produced during test execution.

4. ISCSI Initiator Host should NOT probe any LUs except the ISCSI 
   Target Host and be bound with only one ISCSI Target Host for testing.

5. The SUNWstc-tetlite test harness package is required to be installed
   on the ISCSI Target host, or to be accessible via NFS.

6. ISCSI Initiator and Target hosts should be set up to accept scp and 
   ssh from test hosts (by root) and also allow root remote login.

7. ISCSI Initiator Host requires that the following package(s) are 
   installed on the test host:
        - SUNWdiskomizer 
	- The SunWdiskomizer pkg must be installed in the default directory:
	  /opt/SUNWdiskomizer 

It is assumed that the following INSTALLATION, CONFIGURATION, EXECUTION 
steps are performed in a single shell environment, or, if they are performed
in different shell environments, the environment variables CTI_ROOT and
and PATH are set up properly.

CTI-TET PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
===========================
For example, as root do the following :
	pkgadd -d /ws/stcnv-gate/packages/`uname -p` SUNWstc-tetlite

It is also acceptable to use an NFS-accessible location of the tetlite package.

TEST SUITE INSTALLATION:
=======================
The test suite can be installed locally to the testing system or
accessed via nfs over the network from a server.  For example, to install the
test root, as root do:
	pkgadd -d /ws/stcnv-gate/packages/`uname -p` SUNWstc-storage-comstar

It is also acceptable to use an NFS accessible location of the test suite
package.

TEST SUITE CONFIGURATION :
========================
Test suite configuration must be done as root.
	
1. Set up the following environment variables
	# CTI_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite/contrib/ctitools
	# PATH=$CTI_ROOT/bin:$PATH

2. To configure the test suite :

# run_test \
  -v TRANSPORT=SOCKETS
  -v EXPECT=<EXPECT Script Parser Location>
  -v ISCSI_THOST=<ISCSI Target IP Addr> \
  -v ISCSI_IHOST=<ISCSI Initiator IP Addr> \
  -v ISNS_HOST=<ISNS Target IP Addr> \
  -v "BDEVS=\"<Block disk device separated by space>\"" \ 
  	(Example: -v "BDEVS=\"/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s2 /dev/dsk/c0t2d0s2\"")
  -v "RDEVS=\"<Raw disk device separated by space>\"" \ 
  	(Example: -v "RDEVS=\"/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2 /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0s2\"")
  comstar iscsi_configure

The configuration file will be created as a result of the arguments specified 
in the run_test command line.  

Other configurable variables that can be set in the configuration line :

TRANSPORT	- [ SOCKETS or ALL transport can be specified ]
		- SOCKETS transport goes through only the ethernet interfaces
		- ALL transport goes through all the networking interfaces

EXPECT		- [ Expect script parser location ] is optional
		- default is /usr/bin/expect

ISCSI_THOST	- [ iscsi target host ip address ] is a must
		- only supports one target initiator host nowadays

ISCSI_IHOST	- [ iscsi initiator host ip address ] is a must
		- only supports one iscsi initiator host nowadays

ISNS_HOST	- [ isns server host ip address ] is a must

BDEVS		- [ block disk device list ] is a must

RDEVS		- [ raw disk device list ] is a must

ISCSI_TARGET_SWITCH_PORT
		- [ ethernet interface topology on switch ] is obsolete 
		  temporarily
		- switch cable pull is unsupported currently

RADIUS_HOST	- [ radius server host ip address ] is optional
		- radius authentication feature is unsupported currently
		- RADIUS_HOST defaults to ISCSI_IHOST implicitly for 
		  itadm utility testing

TEST SUITE EXECUTION :
==================== 

The following setup is required prior to the test run.

   - Allow root to do ssh and scp to/from the remote initiator.  Require .ssh setup 
     for root.

   - Allow root to log in remotely.  Require changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
     Make sure the following lines are in remote's sshd_config file.

             PermitRootLogin yes
             PermitRootLogin without-password

     and restart the service.

The test suite execution is required to be done as root.

To run the entire test suite do the following.

# run_test comstar iscsi

To execute individual scenarios (itadm iscsi_auth iscsi_discovery iscsi_io
iscsi_fs iscsi_smf iscsi_visible)

# run_test comstar <scenario>

# run_test comstar itadm

To execute Test Purposes within a scenario :

# run_test comstar iscsi/<test case dir>:<test purpose number>

# run_test comstar iscsi/auth:1
# run_test comstar iscsi/auth:1-2
# run_test comstar iscsi/auth:1,2

Test case directories are iscsi,itadm

TEST SUITE UNCONFIGURE :
======================

# run_test comstar iscsi_unconfigure
