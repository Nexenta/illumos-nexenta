DESCRIPTION:
===========
This test suite is mainly designed to test the functionality of COMSTAR 
(Common Multiprotocol SCSI Target) 

PREREQUISITES:
============
1. test configuration need FC Initiator and FC Target hosts, which are 
   both connected with Qlogic Switch. FC Initiator Host will reboot 
   itself automatically during Fault Injection testing.

2. FC Target Host should NOT have any existing LUs and related configuration 
   information such as target group, host group, view entry and mapping 
   association before test execution. 

3. FC Target Host should disable other target port providers like disable 
   SMF service /network/iscsi/target, disable smf serverice /system/iscsitgt.
   Otherwise, unexpected test failures will result.

4. FC Initiator Host should NOT probe any LUs except FC Target Host and 
   be bound to only one FC Target Host for testing.

5. The SUNWstc-tetlite test harness package is required to be installed, 
   or be accessible via nfs.

6. FC Initiator and Target hosts should accept rcp and rsh calls from 
   test hosts.

7. FC Initiator Host requires that the following package(s) are 
   installed on the test host:
        - SUNWdiskomizer 
                location of latest version and install instructions at:
               	http://diskomizer.eng/latest/Downloading_Diskomizer.html
               	pkgadd -d http://diskomizer.eng.sun.com/6.1GA/SUNWdiskomizer.pkg
	 The SunWdiskomizer pkg must be installed in the default directory:
	 /opt/SUNWdiskomizer 

8. For QLOGIC HBA, it's mandatory to switch into target mode by manual 
   procedures after OS refresh installation. Please refer to the web page 
   on opensolaris.org:
        http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/comstar/Documentation/AdminGuide

It is assumed that following INSTALLATION, CONFIGURATION, EXECUTION steps are 
performed in a single shell environment. If they are performed in different
shell environment, please set up CTI_ROOT and PATH properly.


CTI-TET PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
=============================
As root do the following :
	pkgadd -d /ws/stcnv-gate/packages/`uname -p` SUNWstc-tetlite

It is also acceptable to use an NFS-accessible location of the tetlite package.

TEST SUITE INSTALLATION:
=======================
The test suite can be installed locally to the testing system or
accessed via nfs over the network from a server.  To install the
test root, as root do:
	pkgadd -d /ws/stcnv-gate/packages/`uname -p` SUNWstc-storage-comstar

It is also acceptable to use an NFS accessible location of the test suite
package.

ALTERNATIVELY, the test suite source can be installed and built.  To
build the test suite source, as any user, do:
	$ workspace create /export/STC	(example path)
	$ bringover -p /ws/stcnv-gate -w /export/STC usr/closed/suites/storage/comstar
	$ CTI_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite/contrib/ctitools
	$ PATH=$CTI_ROOT/bin:$PATH
	$ cd /export/STC/usr/closed/suites/storage/comstar
	$ /usr/ccs/bin/make

To install test suite binaries in the proto tree, do
	$ /usr/ccs/bin/make install
To create installable test suite packages, do
	$ /usr/ccs/bin/make package

TEST SUITE CONFIGURATION:
=========================
Test suite configuration must be done as root.
	
1. Set up the following environment variables
	# CTI_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite/contrib/ctitools
	# PATH=$CTI_ROOT/bin:$PATH

2. To configure the test suite :

# run_test \
  -v FC_IHOST=<FC Initiator IP Addr> \
  -v EXPECT=<EXPECT Script Parser Location> \
  -v "BDEVS=\"<Block disk device list separated by space>\"" \ 
  	(Example: -v "BDEVS=\"/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s2 /dev/dsk/c0t2d0s2\"")
  -v "RDEVS=\"<Raw disk device list separated by space>\"" \ 
  	(Example: -v "RDEVS=\"/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2 /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0s2\"")
  -v FC_TARGET_SWITCH_PORT=<FC Switch Model:FC Switch IP:Admin:Passwd:Port1,Port2...> \
	(Example: -v FC_TARGET_SWITCH_PORT=QLOGIC:127.0.0.1:admin:password:1,2)
  comstar-tests fc_configure

The configuration file will be created as a result of the arguments specified 
in the run_test command line.  There is no need to manually edit the 
configuration file as is required by some of the other test suites. 

Other configurable variables that can be set in the configuration line :

FC_IHOST	- [ fc initiator host ip address ] is a must
		- only supports one fc initiator host nowadays

EXPECT		- [ Expect script parser location ] is optional
		- defaults to /usr/bin/expect

BDEVS		- [ block disk device list ] is a must

RDEVS		- [ raw disk device list ] is a must

FC_TARGET_SWITCH_PORT
		- [ fc target host topology in fabric switch ] is a must
		- QLOGIC and BROCADE fabric switches are supported
		- for fault injection testing of target side cable pull 

TEST SUITE EXECUTION :
====================
The test suite execution is required to be done as root.

To run the entire test suite do the following.

# run_test comstar-tests fc

To execute individual scenarios (sbdadm stmfadm misc fcinfo libstmf)

# run_test comstar-tests <scenario>

# run_test comstar-tests sbdadm

To execute Test Purposes within a scenario :

# run_test comstar-tests sbdadm/<test case dir>:<test purpose number>

# run_test comstar-tests sbdadm/create:1
# run_test comstar-tests stmfadm/create:1-2
# run_test comstar-tests fc/fault/forcelip:1,2

Test case directories are sbdadm, stmfadm, misc, fault, and libstmf

TEST SUITE UNCONFIGURE :
======================

# run_test comstar-tests fc_unconfigure
